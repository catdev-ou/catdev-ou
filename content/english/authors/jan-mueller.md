With over 15 years of rich and diverse experience in IT, I've traversed through multiple domains from engineering to project management. For me, computer science isn't just a profession; it's a passion that intricately weaves into every facet of my life.

I'm a staunch advocate for automation, believing that streamlining processes frees up valuable time for innovation. Viewing IT solution development as a holistic journey, I prioritize not only meeting customer requirements but also continuously enhancing areas like cybersecurity and tool maintenance.

Over the years, I've lent my expertise to various endeavors, ranging from supporting clients in application development to architecting highly scalable storage solutions. I'm deeply committed to ensuring systems' integrity by meticulously analyzing and conducting penetration tests.

Furthermore, I'm a strong proponent of DevOps principles, seamlessly integrating them into development processes wherever feasible. By leveraging best practices, I strive to optimize workflows and drive efficiencies across the board.
